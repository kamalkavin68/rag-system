## Query Transformation

![Query Flow](./documentation/query-transformation.svg)

### Query Transformation Process Diagram

This diagram illustrates the sophisticated query transformation pipeline that enhances user queries for better information retrieval:

**Primary Flow:**
- **Raw Query**: User's original input query enters the system
- **Query Transformation (LLM)**: Large Language Model processes the raw query to generate multiple enhanced versions
- **Transformed Query**: Final output ready for vector search operations

**Enhancement Processes:**
- **Rewritten Query**: Improves clarity and specificity of the original query using advanced language understanding
- **Expanded Queries**: Generates related queries to capture broader context and handle implicit information needs
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex multi-faceted queries into manageable sub-components

**Technical Implementation:**
The query transformation process operates through iterative refinement, where each enhancement type contributes to comprehensive context retrieval. The LLM analyzes the raw query's intent, identifies implicit requirements, and generates multiple query variations that collectively capture the full scope of the user's information need.

**Optimization Impact:**
This multi-query approach ensures that complex questions receive thorough context coverage, leading to more accurate and complete responses. The system handles questions that might require information from different document sections or topics by generating targeted sub-queries.

## Chunking Strategies

![Query Flow](./documentation/Chunking-Strategies.svg)

### Semantic Chunking Process Diagram

This diagram shows the advanced document processing pipeline that maintains semantic coherence while optimizing for retrieval performance:

**Input Processing:**
- **Data Loading**: Documents are loaded from various sources with format-specific parsing
- **Embedding Model**: Google's embedding-001 model generates vector representations for semantic analysis

**Core Chunking Process:**
- **Semantic Chunking Process**: Central component that implements intelligent document segmentation
  - **Breakpoint Type**: Uses percentile-based thresholds for semantic boundary detection
  - **Threshold**: Set at 85th percentile for optimal balance between coherence and granularity
  - **Method**: Similarity-based splitting using embedding comparisons to preserve context

**NLP Enhancement Pipeline:**
- **spaCy NLP Pipeline**: Utilizes pre-trained model en_core_web_sm for advanced text processing
- **NLP Feature Extraction**: Identifies and extracts semantic elements from text chunks
  - **Entity Labels**: Recognizes named entities (PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE, MONEY)
  - **Classification**: Categorizes text elements for improved retrieval matching

**Post-Processing:**
- **Token Normalization**: Standardizes text through lowercase conversion and punctuation removal
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Adds semantic context and entity information to each chunk for enhanced retrieval

**Technical Advantages:**
This approach ensures that document chunks maintain semantic integrity while providing rich metadata for improved search relevance. The percentile-based breakpoint method prevents arbitrary text splitting that could fragment important concepts across multiple chunks.

## Retrieval & Reranking Strategies

![Query Flow](./documentation/Retrieval-Reranking-Flow.svg)

### Advanced Retrieval and Reranking Process

This diagram illustrates the sophisticated retrieval system that maximizes context relevance through multiple scoring mechanisms:

**Query Processing:**
- **Query Embedding Generation**: Converts processed queries into vector representations for similarity matching
- **Multi-Query Search**: Executes multiple search operations for comprehensive context coverage

**Vector Retrieval:**
- **Vector Retrieval**: Performs initial similarity search against the vector database using cosine similarity

**Advanced Reranking Process:**
The system implements a multi-factor scoring approach:
- **Enhanced Similarity Scoring**: Base cosine similarity calculation between query and document vectors
- **NLP Feature Matching**: Matches linguistic features between query and document chunks
- **Entity/Noun Alignment**: Provides bonus scoring for chunks containing query-relevant named entities and key nouns
- **Contextual Relevance Boost**: Additional scoring for chunks that demonstrate strong topical alignment

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Final Score = Cosine Similarity + Entity Bonus + Noun Bonus + Chunk Bonus
Enhanced Score: 0.85 minimum threshold
```

**Cosine Similarity Between Documents**

This analysis computes the **cosine similarity** between a set of documents. Cosine similarity helps identify how closely related the text content of different documents is, based on their vector representations.

### Input Documents

1. **Document 0**:  
   *"The Amazon rainforest, Paris is the capital of France. It is known for the Eiffel Tower."*

2. **Document 1**:  
   *"The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world."*

3. **Document 2**:  
   *"The Amazon online shopping platform is one of the largest e-commerce companies."*

4. **Document 3**:  
   *"The moon is Earth's only natural satellite."*

5. **Document 4**:  
   *"Basketball is a sport played by two teams of five players."*

6. **Document 5**:  
   *"Amazon"*


   **Query**
   *"Amazon rainforest"*

### üîç Cosine Similarity

The cosine similarity score ranges from **0 (completely different)** to **1 (identical)**. The matrix below shows pairwise similarity among the documents.

### Similarity Graph

Below is a visual representation of the cosine similarity values between the documents:

![Cosine Similarity Graph](./documentation/output-3.png)

> In the graph, higher similarity scores are shown with thicker or darker lines (or closer nodes), while unrelated documents appear further apart or disconnected.

---

### üß† Observations

- Documents 0, 1, 2, and 5 contain the word ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù and show stronger similarities.
- Document 3 and 4 are contextually unrelated to the ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù topic and have low similarity to others.
- Document 5 ("Amazon") acts like a keyword, showing moderate similarity with all Amazon-related documents.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

Cosine similarity is effective for:
- Identifying document clusters by topic
- Understanding semantic relationships
- Improving retrieval tasks in search and RAG pipelines

**Output:**
- **Retrieved Chunks**: Top-ranked document segments that provide the most relevant context for response generation

**Performance Optimization:**
The reranking process ensures that the most contextually appropriate chunks are selected, leading to more accurate and comprehensive responses. The multi-factor scoring approach captures both semantic similarity and entity-level relevance.

## Response Validation & Quality Assurance

![Query Flow](./documentation/validate-response-img-2.svg)

### Response Validation and Quality Control System

This diagram demonstrates the comprehensive validation pipeline that ensures response accuracy and prevents hallucinations:

**Input Components:**
- **Retrieved Chunks**: Relevant document segments that provide factual context
- **Generative Response**: Initial AI-generated response based on retrieved context

**Validation Process:**
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Acts as an intelligent validator that analyzes response quality
- **Generative Response Validator**: Implements dual-stage validation with specific criteria

**Validation Criteria:**
1. **Response Matching Context**: Ensures generated content aligns with provided document context
2. **Prevent Hallucination**: Identifies and flags information not present in source documents

**Decision Flow:**
- **Valid Response**: Responses that pass validation criteria are approved for user delivery
- **Invalid Response**: Responses that fail validation trigger the reprocessing pipeline
- **Re-processing**: Automatic regeneration of responses using refined context or alternative approaches

**Quality Assurance Features:**
The validation system performs multiple checks including factual consistency, context alignment, and completeness verification. The automated retry mechanism ensures that users receive accurate, well-grounded responses rather than potentially misleading generated content.

**Technical Implementation:**
The validator uses the same LLM architecture as the response generator but with specialized prompts focused on accuracy assessment rather than content creation. This approach leverages the model's understanding capabilities while maintaining strict quality standards.
